Some important Points to remember :-

1.  # include function mainly works as import function and import modules 
    like stdio.h and conio.h into the programs .

2.  stdio.h and Conio.h are like libraries which are mainly use to
    import the function like printf and getch() .

3.  The function which can be import under stdio.h are :-


    sl_no. -> Function -> use of the function
    1 -> printf() - It is used to print the strings, integer, character etc on the output screen.
    2 -> scanf() - It reads the character, string, integer etc from the keyboard.
    3 -> getc() - It reads the character from the file.
    4 -> putc() - It writes the character to the file.
    5 -> fopen() - It opens the file and all file handling functions are defined in stdio.h header file.
    6 -> fclose() - It closes the opened file.
    7 -> remove() - It deletes the file.
    8 -> fflush() - It flushes the file.

4.  The function which can be import under conio.h are :-
    
    sl.no. ->  Functions -> Description
    1 -> clrscr( ) -> used to clear the output screen
    2 -> getch() ->	It reads character from the keyboard
    3 -> getche() -> reads character from keyboard and echoes to o/p screen
    4 -> textcolor() -> used to change the text color
    5 -> textbackground() -> used to change text background

5. If u want to get the a.exe in another name. Then you maninly write gcc main.c -o nameyouwanttogive

6. There are total 4 types of data input types in C :
    1 -> int 
    2 -> float 
    3 -> character
    4 -> double 

7. All escape sequence are :
    new line -> \n 
    long space -> \t
    alert sound -> \a 

8. Format Specifier :
   %d  -> integer 
   %f -> float 
   %c -> character 
   %s -> string 

9. There are Two types of comment :-
   Single comment line -> // 
   Muntiple Comment line -> /*  */

10. Arithmatic Operators :-
    + -> Addition 
    - -> Substraction 
    * -> Muntiplication 
    / -> quotient 
    % -> remainder

11. ASCII -> American Standard Code for Information and Interchange 
    alphabets  ->  ASCII
    A - Z      -> 65 to 90
    a - z      -> 97 to 122
    0 - 9      -> 48 to 57 

12. The Data type in C - programs are :-
      1) Basic Date Type 
      2) Derived Data Type 
      3) Emumeration Data Type 
      4) Void Data Type 

13. The Derived data types are :-
       1) arrays 
       2) pointer 
       3) structure 
       4) Union 

14. Emumeration data type -> enum 

15. Void data type -> void 

16. Break Statment are mainly stops the process if the condition is satisfied .

17. Continue Statment is used to continue the loop except the condition part .

18. slno. -> Function ->      Use
      1   -> strlen   ->    calculates the length of string
      2   -> strcat   ->	Appends one string at the end of another
      3   -> strncat  ->	Appends first n characters of a string at the end of another
      4   -> strcpy   ->	Copies a string into another
      5   -> strncpy  ->	Copies first n characters of one string into another
      6   -> strcmp   ->	Compares two strings
      7   -> strncmp  ->	Compares first n characters of two strings
      8   -> strchr   ->	Finds the first occurrence of a given character in a string 
      9   -> strrchr  ->	Finds the last occurrence of a given character in a string
      10  -> strstr   ->	Finds the first occurrence of a given string in another string
      11  -> strcspn  ->	Calculates the initial length of a string, not containing any character of the other string
      12  -> strspn   ->	Calculates the initial length of a string, containing the only characters of the other string
      13  -> strpbrk  ->	Finds the first occurrence of any of the characters of a string in another string
      14  -> strtok   ->	splits a string into token

19. For string we use gets() in place of scanf() because in a sentence there are gaps and scanf() terminates at the gap and no further word is printed.
    gets() don't terminate at gaps and print both space and the full sentence without terminateing any thing.
