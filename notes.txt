Some important Points to remember :-

1.  # include function mainly works as import function and import modules 
    like stdio.h and conio.h into the programs .

2.  stdio.h and Conio.h are like libraries which are mainly use to
    import the function like printf and getch() .

3.  The function which can be import under stdio.h are :-


    sl_no. -> Function -> use of the function
    1 -> printf() - It is used to print the strings, integer, character etc on the output screen.
    2 -> scanf() - It reads the character, string, integer etc from the keyboard.
    3 -> getc() - It reads the character from the file.
    4 -> putc() - It writes the character to the file.
    5 -> fopen() - It opens the file and all file handling functions are defined in stdio.h header file.
    6 -> fclose() - It closes the opened file.
    7 -> remove() - It deletes the file.
    8 -> fflush() - It flushes the file.

4.  The function which can be import under conio.h are :-
    
    sl.no. ->  Functions -> Description
    1 -> clrscr( ) -> used to clear the output screen
    2 -> getch() ->	It reads character from the keyboard
    3 -> getche() -> reads character from keyboard and echoes to o/p screen
    4 -> textcolor() -> used to change the text color
    5 -> textbackground() -> used to change text background

5. If u want to get the a.exe in another name. Then you maninly write gcc main.c -o nameyouwanttogive

6. There are total 4 types of data input types in C :
    1 -> int 
    2 -> float 
    3 -> character
    4 -> double 

7. All escape sequence are :
    new line -> \n 
    long space -> \t
    alert sound -> \a 

8. Format Specifier :
   %d  -> integer 
   %f -> float 
   %c -> character 
   %s -> string 

9. There are Two types of comment :-
   Single comment line -> // 
   Muntiple Comment line -> /*  */

10. Arithmatic Operators :-
    + -> Addition 
    - -> Substraction 
    * -> Muntiplication 
    / -> quotient 
    % -> remainder

11. ASCII -> American Standard Code for Information and Interchange 
    alphabets  ->  ASCII
    A - Z      -> 65 to 90
    a - z      -> 97 to 122
    0 - 9      -> 48 to 57 

12. The Data type in C - programs are :-
      1) Basic Date Type 
      2) Derived Data Type 
      3) Emumeration Data Type 
      4) Void Data Type 

13. The Derived data types are :-
       1) arrays 
       2) pointer 
       3) structure 
       4) Union 

14. Emumeration data type -> enum 

15. Void data type -> void
